I created a visualization dashboard website to show plotted weather data.

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which you can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where you can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where you can view the data used to build them.
